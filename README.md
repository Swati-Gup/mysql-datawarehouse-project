#  Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

This project repository 'mysql-datawarehouse-project' demonstrates building a comprehensive modern data warehouse with MySQL, based on the Medallion architecture. It includes ETL processes, data modeling and analytics.


## Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion architecture with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into MySQL Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.


## Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a modern Data Warehouse using Medallion architecture with the **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.
